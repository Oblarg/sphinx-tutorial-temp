Getting Started with Sphinx
===========================

This document will guide users through starting a Sphinx documentation project with the MRWolf Sphinx Template.

Official Sphinx Docs
--------------------

In order to use the Sphinx Documentation Template, it's first necessary to familiarize yourself with Sphinx.

Thankfully, Sphinx has extensive documentation; accordingly, users should first skim the official sphinx docs, and keep it on hand as a reference while using the template:

`http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/`__

The official Sphinx documentation will be referred to extensively throughout this guide.

The MRWolf Sphinx Template
--------------------------

The MRWolf Sphinx Template is a baseline Sphinx project set up with the Munich Re company branding and color scheme.  It is the standard foundation that all MRWolf project-level documentation should be based on.

That said, nothing in this template is "set in stone."  Users should not change things haphazardly, as consistency in documentation across projects is extremely important for facilitating readability, but the extremely customizeable nature of Sphinx means that nearly anything can be changed, if desired.  The proivded default settings should work for most projects, but are recommendations only.

Starting Your Project from the Template
---------------------------------------

The first step to starting a MRWolf Sphinx Documentation project is to copy the template's git repository into your own documentation project's repository.

Hosting Your Project
--------------------

After the project has been started, it's time to set up hosting - once the hosting process has been configured, your documentation will be automatically built and hosted from your documentation project repository.
